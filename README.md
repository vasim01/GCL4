# GCL4
This is a project for gcl4 code solution discussed within the classes.
Programs here will mostly be written in java.
Will try to add the solutions in more languages.

Basic Steps for execution of the programs
1. Open mac terminal/ windows cmd/ linux shell.
2. reach to the same file location using change directory command (cd filelocation_path)
3. enter "javac filename.java".
for instance: javac SortedBooleanMatrix.java
4. Once your file gets compiled with no errors then enter "java filename"
for instance: java SortedBooleanMatrix
5. Provide the required input.
6. Check the output.

See below for example:
--------------------------
del1-lmac:code user$ javac SortedBooleanMatrix.java

del1-lmac:code user$ java SortedBooleanMatrix

Enter the length of matrix in 'm x n' format

3 x 7

Enter boolean matrix data in 0 or 1 separated by one space like  0 0 1 1 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 1

Enter boolean matrix data in 0 or 1 separated by one space like  0 0 1 1 0

0 0 1 1 1 1 1

Enter boolean matrix data in 0 or 1 separated by one space like  0 0 1 1 0

0 1 1 1 1 1 1

Enterd matrix is:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1 

0 0 1 1 1 1 1 

0 1 1 1 1 1 1 

Output: Max 1s found in row:2, 1s count:6
